```{tab-item} Things I learned
- Git status command was very useful once I transitioned to using version control 
to complete the assignment.
- Command line exercises came in handy when troubleshooting issues with the built book
(i.e. tracking down the images folder).
- ghp-import works well!
```

```{tab-item} Things I found difficult
- Some markup features weren't working: had issues with citations, 
images showing, and section indices.
- Git authentication is annoying.
